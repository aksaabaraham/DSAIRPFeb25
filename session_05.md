# Demystifying Terms Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence
  data science - analysing raw data and extract into a meaningful insight 
  AI - basically mimic human intelligence by observing analysing these data 
  ML - ML is a subset of AI that is used for prediction by learning the data and creating algorithms for the further purposes.

## Artificial General Intelligence
## History of Artificial Intelligence
### Perceptron
    perceptron is single artificial neural network like human nueron. 
    recieves input values and sum the weights after that applies activation functions to the sum
    Perceptrons are used in machine learning and deep learning
    They are used in machine-driven image recognition
